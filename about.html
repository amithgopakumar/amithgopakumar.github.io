       <h2>About Me </h2>
        <p>Technology is always a crazy thing to me, below para gives idea about my journey to be a maker .</p>
        <p>Childhood onwards I am a little crazy and curious about electronic gadgets whenever I got a chance to open it I don't miss that...
          Father bought me toy cars but rather than playing with that my interest to know how it works. So I  always open it taken out the things inside the toys,
          and make something new. I made a toy boat using Ujala bottle ( commonly available washing chemical in Indian market)...these things were done years ago.
          However, my craziness to explore technologies and to make matters still be continuing.</p>
        <p>From rural background, computer and internet be luxury things in our school day. Still, things changed when I joined my 12th in the computer stream,
           I got the opportunity to learn about computers,and liitle bit to programming, during 7th and 8th grade I got opurtuniy to use compuers in schools but very less 2 or 3 periods in a year.
           .. but even at that time, don't have my own personal computer to learn new things.</p>
        <p>Like technology, the world is also changing fast. In my school, I used the Intel Pentium machine and learned turbo c++. But when joined in engineering,
          Father bought me a Sony I3 machine with 2.3ghz clock speed and 8 GB ram, When compare the Performace of I3 at those times amazing, I3  are much better in
          performance as well as in energy-efficient than Pentiums. College Internet helps to learn a lot of new things, and from there I heard the name Arduino:
          Famous open-source maker board in the world for those who want to make simple prototypes.</p>
        <p>After graduation journey to maker field starts, worked with Kerala govt to supports to build the startup ecosystem. One and Half year with Intel and NITI Ayog to support ATl labs,
          helps met contribute as TeacherIn Maker field. During my childhood, i don't get similar opportunities similar to ATL. Still, this times kids got the chance to start from their early ages
          when helping them to do their projects to prototypes I learned new things also. During that time, I also have done the Digital Fabrication Course from Fab Lab Kerala. Six months of Intensive programs
          give Ideas about digital Manufacturing technologies, how to make prototypes using digitaltools, learned to use CNC, 3D printer etc. </p>
        <p>When Support for ATL project is over, I quit the job and joined in Firm supports rehabilitation to differentially abled persons. Opportunity
          to work in Assistive area gives Lots happiness because as maker here I can contribute more. During this time frame, I completed the Six-month training
          program on developing Assistive technology solutions;it adds few feathers to my learning.</p>
        <p>Internet become affordable to  all and lots of technical blogs, pages, tutorials are all over online, faster way of information with in our finger tip helps alo to learn new things.
           journey is explained here, but it gives small  bit of idea .............Thanks for reading </p>
